This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Pygame for the graphical interface and the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the AI opponent. The game features a single-player mode where you play as 'O' against an intelligent AI playing as 'X'. It includes an interactive board where you can click on an empty square to make a move, and the AI will respond automatically. The game detects win and draw conditions and ends accordingly. To get started, ensure you have Python 3.x and Pygame installed. Clone the repository from https://github.com/Prabhav-patel/Tic-Tac-Toe-AI , navigate to the project directory, and run pip install pygame to install the required library. You can then start the game by executing python main.py.
